2. I learned how to make up pop-up.
3. Through the modifier and js did the hiding and opening of the pop-up.
4. I got into the basics a bit and started using JavaScript more consciously.
5. I started to formulate my questions more correctly and accurately, and Google them (yandex:D).
6. I started naming commits more competently and consciously, using branches.

### The difference from all past projects is that here (in the 2nd version):
